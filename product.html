				<h3>Global Story</h3>
				<p>Video Assiatant Referee otherwise known as VAR was first introduced to the footballing world around 10 years ago in the early 2010s. While it was not at all popular in its early years, it quickly gained momentum and is now used by nearly all of the top leagues in world football. Its purpose and objective is to make the game of football more fair and less susceptible to refereeing error. This recent development, for better or worse, has undoubtedly changed the game of football in a variety of ways.</p>

				<h3>What Does VAR Solve?</h3>
				<p>The main purpose behing VAR is to account for <em>error</em> among referees. While there are typically three field referees at each match, (two linesman and one head referee) they are not always able to make the correct call whether that be for a potential penalty or for a pass that was offsides. Even the best referees in the world make errors from time to time. VAR is meant to help with that as it allows referees to review specific calls by looking at film that replays the situation. The referee can then change their decision or keep it the same based off of when they saw in the video.</p>

			<article id="article3">
				<h3>How It Works</h3>
				<p>If the referee has made a decision (typically one regarding a penalty, offsides call or a red card) they are able to review their decision using VAR. This is done by having the referee run to the side of the field where there is a small screen meant for the eyes of the referee only, the screen replays the call moment that the referee made their decision on and shows multiple angles for the referee to look at and view. At times this can lead to the referee to stick with their previous decision but most often, if a referee uses VAR, they typically change their original call.</p>

				<h3>Where Is It Used? By Who?</h3>
				<p>Video Assistant Refereeing is most commonly used among the top flight divisions of world football. This includes leagues in Europe, South America, Asia and a large number of others. The resources and expenses required to use VAR is one of the main resasons as to why itis not used among all football leagues and divisions. Nonetheless, when it comes to the most competetive matches, tournaments and leagues, VAR will most definitely be present as it is also used by come of the top referees in the footballing world. </p>
			</article>
			
			<article id="article5">
				<h3>What To Expect</h3>
				<p>In terms of what can be excpected with the use of VAR, it is intented that the number of mistakes made by referees during a match is reduced to nearly zero. While small decisions are hardly ever taken to VAR, it is the big calls that could potentially decide the outcome of a football match that VAR comes into play. While there is a large population who are against the inclusion among VAR, its purpose is to cut fown the room for error among referees significantly ideally improving the quality of the game. Whether or not VAR actually improves the game of football is largely up for disuccion, but its purpose is the make the game as fair as possible.</p>

				<h3>Future of VAR</h3>
				<p>While VAR is an extremely new and advanced form of sports technology, it still has its flaws. A major flaw being the time that it can take for referees to make a decision when using VAR. It can stop play for a number of minutes which can frustrate, players, fans and even referees themselves. A potential imporvement regarding VAR would be the efficiancy in which it can be used. As leagues try to improve the game each and every day, it is very likely that we will see a variety of changes and innovations regardin VAR in the near future.</p>
